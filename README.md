# 👨‍🔧 Automotive Master Technician | Aspiring Java Developer 💻

With nearly 13 years of experience in the automotive industry, I’ve specialized in vehicle electrical systems and control units. Early in my career, I discovered my passion for diagnosing and repairing complex electronic networks. Over the years, I’ve also enjoyed mentoring others, helping them grow in this field. In my work, I face new challenges almost every day, requiring strong problem-solving skills. I also realized that one of the most valuable skills in this field is knowing how to efficiently search for the right resources to solve problems.

In addition to my primary work, I’ve explored building electrical systems and designing electrical setups for camper vans, and also take part in the building process. For a period of time, building motorhome electrical systems was my main source of income.
My interest in 3D printing introduced me to programming through G-code, sparking a curiosity that led me to learn Python basics. After that, I discovered a high-quality online Java course, and Java became my primary language of choice. I completed the course and received my certification at the end of 2024.

Currently, I’m learning embedded systems programming and working to combine it with my automotive knowledge to develop practical and cost-effective smart electronic systems for motorhomes.

# üë®‚Äçüîß Automotive Master Technician | Aspiring Java Developer üíª

With nearly 12 years of professional experience in the automotive industry, I‚Äôve specialized in vehicle electrical systems and control units. Early in my career, I discovered my passion for diagnosing and repairing complex electronic networks. Over the years, I‚Äôve also enjoyed mentoring others, helping them grow in this field.

In addition to my primary work, I‚Äôve explored building electrical systems and designing electrical setups for camper vans. My interest in 3D printing introduced me to programming through G-code, sparking a curiosity that led me to learn Python for a brief period. After that, I discovered a high-quality online Java course, and Java became my primary language of choice.

In my work, I face new challenges almost every day, requiring strong problem-solving skills. I also realized that one of the most valuable skills in this field is knowing how to efficiently search for the right resources to solve problems. I‚Äôm confident that these skills will serve me well in software development.

I am now fully committed to transitioning into a programming career, dedicating my free time to learning and improving my skills. My ultimate goal is to work as a professional developer, combining my hands-on experience with my growing technical knowledge.
Currently, I‚Äôm finishing the Java core course and advancing with Java frameworks such as JPA and Spring.
